## User Stories

### User Story 1

~~**iteration 1:** As a potential volunteer, I want to be able to sign up on the volunteer platform so that I can contribute to non-profit organizations and view their requests for help.~~

**iteration 2:** As a potential volunteer, I want to see an overview of all possible non-profit organizations so that I can choose which organization I want to assist.
